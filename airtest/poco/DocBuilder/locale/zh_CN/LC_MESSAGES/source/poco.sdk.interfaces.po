"This package (:py:mod:`poco.sdk.interfaces`) defines the main standards "
"for communication interfaces between poco and poco-sdk. If poco-sdk is "
"integrated with an app running on another host or in different language, "
"then poco-sdk is called `remote runtime`. The implementation of these "
"interfaces can be done either remotely or locally depending on your own "
"choice. If it is done locally, refer to :py:mod:`poco.freezeui` for more "
"information."

"Poco needs to communicate with the app runtime under the convention of "
"interfaces described below and these interfaces must be properly "
"implemented. Any object implementing the same interface is replaceable "
"and the communication protocol or transport layer has no limitation. "
"Furthermore, in many cases the communication can be customized that one "
"part of interfaces can use HTTP protocol and other can use TCP."
