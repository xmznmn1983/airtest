Drag and Swipe operations
=========================

Like click, drag and swipe are other types of actions on UI. **Drag** usually starts from and ends to specific UI, while
**Swipe** can be performed from any point to any point.

Drag
----

The following example shows how to swipe or drag the "star" to the "shell".

.. image:: img/drag_to.png

.. code-block:: python

    # coding=utf-8

    from poco.drivers.unity3d import UnityPoco

    poco = UnityPoco()

    # drag the "star" to the "shell"
    poco('star').drag_to(poco('shell'))


Swipe
-----

The following example shows how to scroll a list by using swipe.

.. image:: img/scroll1.gif

.. code-block:: python

    # coding=utf-8

    from poco.drivers.unity3d import UnityPoco

    poco = UnityPoco()

    # swipe the list view up
    poco('Scroll View').swipe([0, -0.1])
    poco('Scroll View').swipe('up')  # the same as above, also have down/left/right
    poco('Scroll View').swipe('down')

    # perform swipe without UI selected
    x, y = poco('Scroll View').get_position()
    end = [x, y - 0.1]
    dir = [0, -0.1]
    poco.swipe([x, y], end)  # drag from point A to point B
    poco.swipe([x, y], direction=dir)  # drag from point A toward given direction and length
