Hierarchy viewer (UI Inspector)
===============================

As poco dives into UI controls, it is very necessary to get to know the UI structure of testing game/app when writing
test script. The hierarchy viewer will do a lot help.

The standalone hierarchy viewer now supports android native apps and Unity3D games (with poco-sdk integrated).

If multiple UI controls overlap, right click and a list of all overlap UI controls will be shown. If you want to view
non-interactive UI, just right click with shift key.

It is also available for android native apps. Simply plug your Android device and enable the **ADB DEBUG MODE**.
On some system, if the adb server cannot start automatically, please input a command in the shell ``adb start-server``
first.
